### Working of Capacitance Sensor 
- Configure the sensor parameters width , length ,thickness and dielctric material 
- Calculate the capacitance for change in thickness 
- Submit the answer to capacitance tab and validate 
- Repeat the steps 2 and 3 to get 5 readings 
- Observe sensor output for change in thickness 

### Thickness measurement of sample sheet 
- Select material of sample sheet 
- Set the output voltage for Air  
- Calculate thickness sensitivity factor for sensor 
- Click on "SHEET" button to place the sample sheet for thickness testing 
- Click on "TEST" button to observe output voltage 
- Calculate sample sheet thickness 
- Enter sheet thickness and validate the answer
