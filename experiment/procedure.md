### Procedure 

### Basic Knowledge - 
- Answer all the questions and click on next level

### Working of Capacitance Sensor - 
- Configure the sesnsor parameters width , length ,thickness and dielctric material 
- calculate the capacitance for change in thickness 
- Submit the answer to capacitance tab and validate 
- Repeat the step 2 and 3  for 5 readings 
- Observe sensor output for change in thickness 

### Thickness measurement of sample sheet 
- Select material of sample sheet 
- Set the output voltage for Air  
- Calculate thickness sensitivity factor for sensor 
- Click on "SHEET" button to place the sample sheet for thickness testing 
- Click on "TEST" button to obeserve output voltage 
- Calculate sample sheet thickness 
- Enter sheet thickness and validate the answer
