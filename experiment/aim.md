### Aim: Design of Capacitive Sensor and its Application for Thickness Measurement.

### Objectives:

- Understand working of capacitive sensor
- Configure capacitive sensor parameters like length, width and thickness
- Observe capacitive sensor output  for change in thickness
- Use capacitive sensor for thickness measurment of sample material sheet
