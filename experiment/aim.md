### Aim: Design of Capacitive Sensor and Use for Thickness Measurement Application.

###Objectives:
-	Understand working of capacitance sensor
-	Configure capacitance sensor parameters like length, width and thickness
-	Observe capacitance sensor output  for change in thickness
-  Use capacitance sensor for thickness measurment of sample sheet
